## What Are Pawpaws?

The pawpaw _(Asimina triloba)_ is a rare and exquisite treat that North Americans seem to have forgotten about somewhere along the way—though of course that's a pretty common story when it comes to native wild foods. These understory trees thrive under forest canopies and along woodland edges, forming dense patches through their clonal growth habit.

Pawpaw trees typically reach 15-30 feet tall and produce large, oblong leaves that create a distinctive leafy canopy. The popularity of the pawpaw as a wild food lies in its unique tropical flavor and its ability to flourish in the deep shade of forest understories.

## Are Pawpaws Edible?

Yes, pawpaws are not only edible but also incredibly flavorful. The sweet fruit has a custard-like flesh with a taste often described as a combination of banana, mango, and cantaloupe. This custardy flesh surrounds several large brown or black seeds. The flesh consistency is smooth and creamy, reminiscent of custard or ice cream, which contributes to its appeal as a wild delicacy.

## Why Forage for Pawpaws?

Foraging for pawpaws offers a rare opportunity to experience a truly native North American fruit that has been largely forgotten by modern agriculture. Native Americans have consumed pawpaws for centuries, appreciating their sweet fruit and nutritional value—they're rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.

Foraging for pawpaws connects us to the land and its seasonal rhythms, offering a unique taste of North America's native biodiversity. But pawpaws also present an exciting opportunity for sustainable, local food production. As interest in native plants and food sovereignty grows, wild pawpaw patches are gaining more attention and pawpaw orchards are beginning to proliferate among savvy organic farmers in the know. (If you live where wild pawpaws grow, keep an eye out at your local farmer's market for cultivated pawpaws when they're in season. You never know!)

## Key Characteristics

- Small understory trees, typically 15-30 feet tall
- Large, oblong leaves forming a leafy canopy
- Green to yellow fruits, 3-6 inches long, with custard-like flesh
- Patch-forming clonal growth habit
- Flowers with a faint carrion scent (like rotting meat), attracting carrion-feeding beetles and flies as pollinators
- Thrives in deep shade of forest understories and edges of forest canopies

## Etymology and Taxonomy

### Common Names

Pawpaw is also known as the "Indian banana" or "custard apple." The name "pawpaw" is believed to derive from the Spanish word "papaya" although the two fruits are unrelated. It's sometimes colloquially referred to as the "poor man's banana" due to its tropical flavor and widespread availability in certain regions.

### Taxonomical Lineage

- [**Annonaceae**](/tags/annonaceae/) (Custard Apple) family
  - [_Asimina_](/tags/asimina/) genus
    - _A. triloba_ species

_Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asimina_triloba)_

The pawpaw is the only member of the custard apple family that extends into temperate North America, making it a unique fruit in the region's forests. The pawpaw's closest relatives are tropical fruits like the cherimoya and soursop which are cultivated for food in other parts of the world.

## Where to Find Wild Pawpaws

Pawpaws grow naturally in 26 states in the eastern United States, ranging from northern Florida to southern Ontario in Canada, and as far west as eastern Nebraska. They thrive in the deep shade of forest understories, along the edges of forest canopies, and in areas with well-drained, fertile soils.

Look for wild pawpaw patches in deciduous forests, often near water sources and in areas with American beech and other common canopy trees. The trees prefer areas with high humidity and protection from strong winds. Their patch-forming clonal growth habit often results in dense stands in suitable habitats.

Pawpaws are finicky fruit producers because they need lots of shade to grow well in their first few years, but then require good sunlight in order to flower. So the ideal pawpaw patch is one that is well established in the shade, but also happens to be growing near a forest edge or clearing where some of the clones get a decent amount of daily sun.

## When to Gather Pawpaws

The pawpaw harvesting season is relatively short, typically running from late August to early October, depending on location. Peak season is usually in September for most of its range. Pawpaw fruits ripen progressively rather than all at once, so you may need to visit a patch multiple times to harvest throughout the season.

The ripening of pawpaws often coincides with the changing of leaves in deciduous forests, making autumn a perfect time for foraging expeditions. Keep in mind that wildlife also enjoys these fruits—and they're not as picky as us humans about ripeness—so competition can be fierce as the season progresses.

## How to Harvest and Prepare Pawpaws

When foraging for pawpaws, look for fruits that are slightly soft when gently squeezed. You can also gently shake the tree—ripe fruits will fall. Don't be afraid to collect fallen fruits from the ground, as they often fall when perfectly ripe. If you find almost-ripe pawpaws, you can let them ripen at room temperature for a few days. They won't ripen up quite as sweet this way, but if it's a choice between slightly-less-awesome fruit and no fruit at all, I think the decision is pretty easy to make. In my experience, this only works well if you're pretty sure the fruit would ripen on the tree within the next few days.

Harvesting pawpaws requires patience and a keen eye. The fruits can be difficult to spot among the leafy canopy, so take your time when examining a pawpaw patch. Fresh pawpaws have a short shelf life, so plan to use them quickly after harvesting.

Pawpaws can be eaten fresh or used in various culinary applications. Their creamy texture makes them perfect for ice cream and other frozen desserts. They can also be used in baked goods, fermented into pawpaw ale, blended into smoothies, or pureed for sauces or spreads. Pawpaw puree can be frozen for later use, extending your enjoyment of this seasonal treat.

Some creative uses for pawpaws include:

- Pawpaw ice cream or gelato
- Pawpaw bread or muffins
- Pawpaw butter (similar to apple butter)
- Pawpaw cocktails or liqueurs
- Pawpaw-flavored beer or ale

How do you know when pawpaws are ripe and ready to eat?

If you're really, really lucky you'll find a ripe, untouched fruit or two that have fallen to the ground, but chances are that the critters of the woods will beat you to those—not to mention many or all of the fruits you'd deem so-close-to-ripe-it's-not-funny.

If you see fruits up in the trees—they can be tricky to spot due to their inconspicuous appearance—give the trunk a good shaking. If the fruits fall, they're most likely ready to eat. They should be soft and a little squishy, with a yellowish hue to the green and brown-black skin. Don't be afraid of bruises! They should look a little beat-up when they're ready, like a questionably overripe banana.

## How to Sustainably Work with Pawpaws

To ensure the continued success of pawpaw populations, practice sustainable foraging by leaving some fruits for wildlife and natural reproduction. Avoid damaging trees when harvesting. The clonal growth habit of pawpaws means that damaging one tree can affect the entire patch.

If you have the space fot them, consider planting pawpaws in your backyard garden or supporting local pawpaw orchards to reduce pressure on wild populations. Backyard pawpaw plants can be a rewarding addition to your garden, providing both fruit and aesthetic value. But keep in mind that pawpaws can't self-pollinate—they require cross-pollination to produce fruit, so you'll need at least two genetically distinct trees.

The cultivation of pawpaws is gaining interest, with some enthusiasts establishing small pawpaw orchards. But commercial pawpaw production remains limited due to the fruit's short shelf life and the challenges of large-scale cultivation, such as the need for hand-pollination in some orchards and the lack of effective pollinators in monoculture settings.

## Pawpaw Lookalikes

Pawpaws have few lookalikes due to their unique appearance. While other members of the custard apple family may look similar, they are not native to North America and would not be confused with our native pawpaw.

The leaf shape and arrangement of pawpaws can be somewhat similar to those of magnolia trees, but the presence of fruit easily distinguishes the two. Magnolias produce large, showy flowers but do not bear fruit that resembles the pawpaw.
