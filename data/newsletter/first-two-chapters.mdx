## Why Forage for Wild Foods?

When all the double cheeseburgers you could ever want are available at a moment's notice, why bother going to all the trouble of learning how to identify and gather wild foods?

The main appeal of foraging, for me, lies in cultivating a more intimate relationship with wild nature in all its beauty, mystery, and abundance.

It's one thing to spend some free time hiking and camping in the woods, but something else entirely to come home with a bag full of wild food from that place—to be nourished physically, mentally, and spiritually by the natural world.

Foraging is also about reclaiming ancestral ways of relating to the landscape around us, and achieving a deeper sense of food security by learning to rely on our own skills and knowledge to gather what we need for a meal from the woods instead of visiting the supermarket.

As we become more familiar with wild edible plants, we start to notice them everywhere—from lawns and gardens to cracks in the pavement.

The landscape, even in the city, somehow becomes a little more vibrant to our eyes.

Wild edible plants are almost always hardier, more vigorous, more flavorful, and more nutritious than their cultivated counterparts.

Best of all, they require no work on our part, aside from harvesting and eating! If you've ever put countless hours of work into a garden only to see it fail, you'll understand why this is such a huge plus.

People haven't always domesticated plants and animals, but wild nature has always supplied us with food.

Only in the last century or so have modern people really abandoned the old ways of foraging for wild plants, and it's up to us as individuals to correct this misstep and learn for ourselves.

Traditionally, as children, we would have absorbed a vast body of knowledge about the land and its resources from our elders. But at some point this lineage of ancestral knowledge ceased to be passed down to most of us.

Both nature and the human spirit have been diminished as a result.

We have the ability to take back this fundamental understanding of how to work with the natural world. It's not hard, but it does require patience, diligence, and careful observation.

If you're interested in learning how to forage but feel intimidated and unsure where to begin, you've come to the right place.

This book was written with the absolute beginner in mind. Maybe you're a gardener who's curious about some of the common garden weeds you've heard are edible; perhaps you're a hiker or wilderness enthusiast who's interested in scoring some of the best trail snacks on Earth, for free.

Regardless of your background or experience, if foraging is new territory for you, I hope this book will be a useful introduction.

I've created a set of seven ground rules that I really think you ought to familiarize yourself with before you ever head out foraging in earnest. Think of them—along with the rest of Part One of this book—as a remedial education in foraging before you dig in deep.

I believe these guidelines will serve as a strong foundation for you to build upon as you acquire the specialized knowledge of identifying and working with the specific plants that grow near you.

From there, I'll sketch out the seasonal flow of wild foods, and explain how to properly harvest, prepare, and preserve all of the different kinds of wild foods that we eat. Then we'll talk about what it really means to eat with the seasons from your local landscape, and discuss the very basics of plant identification and reading the landscape.

Then you might be ready to start venturing out in search of some of the 12 wild edible plants profiled in Part Two.

I have chosen to highlight these plants for several reasons:

- they are easy for the beginner to identify, and have few (if any) lookalikes
- nearly all of them can be found just about anywhere in North America that doesn't experience desert heat or tundra cold
- they require little or no processing to enjoy
- they are among my absolute favorite wild foods

Finally, at the end I'll provide a list of further resources that I would highly recommend to anyone who wants to get serious about foraging and wild plant identification. You can trust the information that I provide, but it's in your best interest to cross-reference any new wild plant you intend to work with for the first time. You are really going to want to pick up at least a few more resources.

Most of what I have to share on the topic of foraging was common sense until pretty recently, but since we didn't inherit this information as children, it's worth spelling out.

If we are diligent in our study and practice of foraging, our children and grandchildren might one day take this activity for granted, as we all should.
We have to start somewhere, and I am so glad that you've decided to jump in.

## Seven Rules of Foraging

### 1. Always leave enough for the remaining population to easily recover.

As far as I'm concerned, this is the most important rule to follow, and if you remember nothing else from this guide I hope it's this:

It is your sole responsibility to ensure the long-term health and sustainability of anything that you forage.

Your impact is always felt by the living community that you take from. By entering into a foraging relationship with that community, you are assuming the responsibility of stewardship – no small task.

This relationship can be extremely rewarding, and a gateway to a much deeper spiritual connection with nature. But you can also very easily cause a plant community to collapse through ignorance, immoderation or disrespect.

Some plants and plant parts can be taken with complete disregard for impact, but others will assuredly die out in future years if you take more than half today. It is up to you, and you alone, to know how much you can take without damaging the population or community.

Knowledge is power, and ignorance can be deadly. So keep reading!

### 2. Never take more than you can use.

This follows naturally from rule number one, but it's worth pointing out directly. Even when you're foraging for a plant that can be harvested indiscriminately, it is still very disrespectful and just unnecessary to take more than you can use.

Why would you? You would only be wasting your time, and potentially killing a whole lot of plants that didn't need to die – and could've been eaten by another creature.

You're not the only creature in your neighborhood who likes mulberries!
I know it sounds obvious and maybe kind of silly to hammer in this point, but it happens to all of us sooner or later: we get so excited about an abundance of some wild food that we go nuts and overdo it.

Nothing is more depressing than watching your Haul Of The Century slowly—or quickly—rot away in your fridge.

Like I said, it will happen to you eventually, despite your best intentions. It's an experience we all should've had as children, but most of us don't come to foraging until adulthood. There's nothing wrong with that—I'm in this camp, too.
Over-harvesting is a natural temptation. When you find yourself guilty of it one day, I hope you learn from it, and make the most of it. We all have many lessons to learn from nature.

## 3. Always do as little damage as possible to the plant and its environment.

This is another rule that extends from the first. When harvesting, be as careful and precise as possible.

When cutting or plucking leaves, be mindful not to excessively damage the stem or branch, as this can invite diseases and viruses into the plant.

When digging roots and tubers, dig with care so as not to cut or disturb neighboring plants. You might only dig up a handful of wild leeks, but you could kill many more around those you harvested through carelessness.

"As little damage as possible" is always relative, and it is something you will have to learn on a plant-by-plant basis.

Some plants and plant communities essentially cannot be damaged by harvesting, while others will deteriorate gradually over a period of many years, and might go unnoticed until it's too late for the remaining population to recover.
Attention to detail when harvesting is crucial.

### 4. Always positively identify anything you plan to eat, beyond a shadow of a doubt.

When in doubt, do not eat! Some plants have no poisonous lookalikes; others have many. Only you can ultimately determine, in the moment, whether you've actually found what you're looking for.

What do I mean by positively identifying a plant?

Well, to negatively identify it would be to say, "I know it's not X plant or Y plant, so it's probably Z, right?"

No! Wrong!

It could be a million other things that you don't want to consume. This can be a dangerous approach.

Positive identification requires a thorough working knowledge of the plant in its growth habits and seasonal variations. You should be familiar with traits like the size and shape of leaves, flowers, and seeds; stem length and thickness; and more—as well as how these things change as the plant matures. You should be able to match several, if not all, of the traits you observe to a known description of the plant in question.

This requires a mix of studying and practice on your part. You should get to know the basic botanical jargon used to describe plant parts, and then take that knowledge out into the field and practice applying it.

I should also note that if you're unsure about the ID of a plant, it's better to leave it where it is and take lots of good photos from many angles, rather than simply plucking a handful and stuffing it in your bag or basket for future reference. It will be much harder to ID later when it's wilted, crushed, and/or discolored, and it might also be tougher to remember the specific microclimate you found it in.

Context can make a big difference: did you find your specimen in a low, wet marsh or a dry open field? On the side of the road, or beneath a specific kind of tree? These kinds of details will aid you in positive identification beyond physical characteristics.

### 5. Always know which parts are edible, when they're edible, and what you must do to prepare them.

Here's one of the most common experiences people have with wild edible plants these days:

"I heard that dandelions are edible, so I plucked a leaf from the ground and gave it a nibble—way too bitter to eat! No thanks! I think I'll stick to good old-fashioned lettuce."

If you've ever been curious about foraging in the past, you're probably familiar with some version of this story—maybe it was your experience, or a friend's, and maybe it discouraged you from digging deeper into the world of edible wild plants.

Well of course those dandelion greens were super bitter! They were probably large leaves from a conspicuous, well-established plant growing in full sun, which tend to be unpalatable.

But if you had harvested some young leaves from a plant growing in the shade, early in spring before its flower stalk appeared, you might have appreciated the bittersweet note that fresh dandelion greens add to a salad or stir-fry.

Or maybe you'd be happier with some freshly gathered dandelion flower "fluff", which makes a wonderfully sweet and aromatic addition to fermented beverages.
This example illustrates the importance of knowing when and how to harvest, which parts to gather, and how to prepare them properly.

Some plants, like wood sorrel, will wilt to the point that they're unusable pretty quickly after harvesting, so it's best to eat them right on the spot. Others, like aronia berries, will be nearly inedible to most people until prepared appropriately. Still other plants will have one part that is delicious and another part that's toxic, or certain developmental stages that are edible and others that are not.

It's not enough simply to be able to identify an edible plant—you must also learn how to work with it.

### 6. Only forage where you're sure it's safe and legal.

When foraging, especially in urban and suburban settings (but increasingly in rural places, too), always be certain that the area is not regularly treated with pesticides, herbicides, or other chemical carcinogens!

It's really pretty insane that we have to look out for poisonous chemicals on our food—whether at the supermarket or the nature preserve—but that's the world that we live in, you know? All we can do is accept reality, minimize our personal exposure, and lead by example.

Roadsides and "conventional" farm fields all across North America are notoriously sprayed with glyphosate (RoundUp) and other toxic chemicals to keep down the growth of "weeds." Unfortunately, some of the most abundant edible wild plants tend to be found in these same spaces, and are sometimes the very same weeds being "managed" with devastating poisons.

When a space has been sprayed with glyphosate, you'll know it within a few days. Plant life will begin to turn yellow, then brown, then wither and die. Areas under chemical management regimens will generally be "treated" two to four times per year, coinciding with ideal moments in the seasons to do the most possible damage. Spring and fall are when spraying crews tend to be most active.

How long after the application of chemicals should we remain concerned about potential contamination?

Great question!

There are no hard and fast answers—in many cases the necessary research has never been conducted—but we know that most common herbicides persist in some form in the soil for several years, stunting plant growth and contaminating groundwater all the while. But I digress.

If you see that a space has been treated with herbicides, you can be pretty certain that i t's a regular occurrence, and you will probably want to avoid gathering there in the future.

Use your own discretion when harvesting from areas like this, which may be regularly treated with pesticides.

When foraging in urban and suburban environments, you might also be reasonably concerned about toxins like car exhaust and other volatile organic compounds (VOCs) accumulating on otherwise choice edible plants.

This is another gray area where we just don't have a whole lot of information. But if you're already living among an invisible cloud of car exhaust in the city, how much of a difference is that handful of potentially contaminated edible greens really going to make? It's honestly hard to say. Wash thoroughly if it makes you feel better.

Once you're sure that your site isn't contaminated, it's generally a good idea to ask for permission before harvesting, whenever possible. Sure, maybe that farmer down the way has no interest in the wild persimmons growing on his hedge row, and wouldn't care if they were harvested, but he probably isn't going to appreciate seeing you trespassing on his property with a sack full of something unknown.

Not only that, but if you make an effort to talk to someone who's responsible for the place where you intend to forage, they might be able to give you definitive answers about how the land is managed, and where else you might find edible plants nearby.

Who knows? Maybe that person appreciates wild mulberries or plums as much as you do, and would be happy to lead you around to some of their favorite trees. There's only one way to find out, right?

The laws and regulations we have regarding foraging for edible wild plants are often vague and antiquated, speaking to a sort of well-intentioned but ultimately misguided (I believe) "Leave No Trace" ethos that just plain misunderstands the role of the human animal in nature.

Don't get me wrong: we should always start from a baseline of "leaving only footprints and taking only photographs" when we don't know how to have a positive impact. But I firmly believe that with the right knowledge and skillset we can leave positive traces of our presence behind us. This is a major theme of this book as a whole.

When I'm out gathering edible wild plants, I'm always looking out for invasive species in the same niche that I might be able to kill, so that native species can reclaim lost ground.

After tearing out invasive French broom in the woodlands of the west coast, I have watched the native strawberries, black raspberries and California lilacs (Ceanothus spp.) pop up out of hiding and reclaim their turf behind me. This is just one small example of how to leave positive traces.

Gathering wild plants is technically illegal in all federal parks and reserves, but the laws leave allowances for local authorities to make exceptions. State and city parks make their own regulations.

In practice the rules will vary from state to state and park to park, but expect to be discouraged from foraging by any authorities you might encounter on the land. I've heard stories of park rangers kicking out hikers for things as innocuous as nibbling on chickweed and rose hips on the edge of a trail. I can assure you that harvesting these is not harmful in any way.

Far be it from me to encourage you to engage in illegal activities, but I feel that civil disobedience in the face of unjust laws is a moral imperative. If a park ranger is unaware of the edibility of a common and abundant herb like chickweed, maybe you're just the person to enlighten them?

All that said, I must urge you to always stick to rule number one here: it is your personal responsibility to understand the full impact you will have on the plants and the land that you work with.

Your ignorance can ruin a beautiful and abundant place for years to come, or at least potentially lead to tighter regulations for everyone else.

### 7. Always remember that the purpose of foraging is to better connect with nature.

Your goal should not be to take from nature at all, but to receive her gifts with respect and moderation, in order to cultivate reverence.

That's what it's all about.

When you eat directly from the land that surrounds you, you are taking part in communion with Mother Nature herself. You are eating the body of the Earth, birthed by the sun, and it is becoming your body.

The line between self and environment begins to blur, and compassion is able to flow beyond the illusory boundaries of our individual selves and into the community of living things that surrounds us.

Is that too Zen of me?

Really though!

Your body is the sum total of the things you eat.

Wouldn't you prefer to be wild, resilient, beautiful, and mysterious? Especially when the alternative is mostly tame, frail, soaked in chemicals, and industrially processed?

We are a part of nature, not apart from it. Foraging is just one way to better understand nature in all its divine splendor. Keep listening, and you'll keep learning.
